# Billing

Dropify® uses a transparent usage-based pricing model with no upfront subscription fees.

## Pricing Structure

**0.75% of order subtotal** - You only pay when you make sales

- **No Monthly Fee**: Zero subscription costs
- **Pay Per Sale**: Charged only on successful orders
- **Monthly Cap**: £9,999.99 maximum charge per month
- **Cancel Anytime**: No long-term commitments

## What's Included

- Order subtotals (product price × quantity)
- Shipping costs
- Taxes and duties

## What's Excluded

- Refunded orders (charges are reversed)
- Test orders during development
- Cancelled orders before fulfilment

## Billing Frequency

Charges are calculated and billed monthly based on your order volume from the previous billing period.

## Fair Usage

The monthly cap ensures predictable costs even during high-volume sales periods. Once the cap is reached, no additional Dropify® charges apply for that billing cycle.
