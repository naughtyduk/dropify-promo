- **Disabled**: Your site is accessible normally without protection

### Enable/Disable Protection

- **Disable Button**: When enabled, clicking this immediately removes protection (with confirmation)

**BE CAREFUL**. Disabling Dropify速 immediately grants access to your site. You'll need to reconfigure your settings to re-enable protection. You will be prompted to confirm your intent to disable.
