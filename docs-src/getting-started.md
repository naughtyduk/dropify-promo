# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Visit the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com) and search for "Dropify"
2. Click **Add app** and follow the installation prompts
3. Authorise the app to access your store

## Prerequisites

Dropify® works with any Shopify theme that includes a `password.liquid` file. Most themes follow this convention, so you likely don't need to worry about compatibility. However, you can verify by going to:

**Online Store** → **⋯** → **Edit Code** → Search for "password" and identify `password.liquid`

## Activation

After installation, you'll need to activate Dropify® through the billing flow:

1. Click **Activate Dropify®** on the initial screen
2. Review and accept the usage-based pricing terms
3. Complete the Shopify billing authorisation
4. You'll be redirected back to the Dropify® dashboard to begin setup
