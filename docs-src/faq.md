# FAQ

## General

### How does Dropify® protect my site?

Dropify® replaces your store's normal content with a countdown landing page by modifying your theme's `password.liquid` file. Customers see your branded countdown instead of your products until the timer expires.

### Can customers still access my admin area?

Yes, Dropify® only affects the customer-facing storefront. You maintain full access to your Shopify admin, orders, and all backend functionality.

### What happens to existing customers during protection?

All visitors see the countdown page, including existing customers. However, customers who submit the form are added to your customer database for future marketing.

## Setup & Configuration

### My theme doesn't have a password.liquid file

Most modern Shopify themes include this file by default. If yours doesn't, you may need to add one or contact your theme developer. Dropify® requires this file to function properly.

### Can I test Dropify® before my actual launch?

Yes, you can enable Dropify® at any time to see how it looks and functions. All test orders are excluded from billing, so you won't be charged during testing.

### How far in advance should I set up my countdown?

You can set your countdown for any future date. Many brands activate Dropify® 1-2 weeks before their launch to build maximum anticipation.

## Customer Data

### Where is customer data stored?

All submitted email addresses and phone numbers are stored in Shopify's native customer records. This makes them immediately available for use with other marketing apps and Shopify's built-in tools.

### How are customers tagged?

All customers created through Dropify® are automatically tagged with "Dropify" and marked as created by the app. This makes it easy to segment and target these contacts later.

### Are customers opted into marketing?

Yes, customers are automatically subscribed to both email and SMS marketing (where applicable) with single opt-in consent. This allows you to contact them about your launch and future promotions.

## Technical

### Does Dropify® slow down my site?

No, Dropify® replaces your normal site content rather than adding to it. The countdown page is optimised for fast loading with efficient code and CDN-delivered assets.

### Can I use custom domains?

Yes, Dropify® works with any domain configuration including custom domains, as it operates within your existing Shopify setup.

### What about SEO during protection?

While protection is active, search engines will see your countdown page instead of product pages. Consider this when planning longer countdown periods.

## Troubleshooting

### My countdown shows the wrong time

Verify that you've selected the correct timezone in Settings. The countdown automatically adjusts for visitors in different time zones, but the base timezone must be accurate.

### Uploaded images aren't displaying

Images may take a few moments to process and become available via CDN. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh the page. Ensure your images meet the size and format requirements.

### Custom fonts aren't loading

Custom fonts require time to propagate through the CDN. If fonts don't appear immediately, wait a few minutes and check again. Ensure your font files are in supported formats (TTF, OTF, WOFF, WOFF2).

### Phone numbers aren't being accepted

Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., +44123456789). Ensure customers include the country code and that the number format is valid.

## Billing

### When am I charged?

Charges are calculated monthly based on orders from the previous billing period. You'll see Dropify® charges on your regular Shopify bill.

### Can I see usage before being charged?

Usage tracking and billing estimates may be available in your Shopify billing section. Contact Shopify support for detailed billing inquiries.

### What happens if I uninstall the app?

Uninstalling Dropify® immediately removes all protection and restores normal site access. Any pending usage charges will still be processed on your next Shopify bill.
